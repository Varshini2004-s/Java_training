Q4.Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden.
She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns 
and numbered the trees in row-wise order. 
She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 
1st column and last column. So given the tree number, 
your task is to find whether the given tree is a mango tree or not?
Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not.
Input format: Input consists of 3 integers

Q6.Matrix Sum
Shobitha and Siddhesh were playing puzzles. They are having two puzzles in their hand.
They need to join the puzzle to get the correct puzzle. Help them to find the puzzle.

Input Format:
The input consists of (m*n+2) integers. The first integer corresponds to m,
the number of rows in the matrix and the second integer corresponds to n, the number of columns in the matrix.
The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix.
The elements are read in row-wise order, first row first, then second row and so on.
Assume that the maximum value of m and n is 10.

Output Format:
Refer sample output for details.
